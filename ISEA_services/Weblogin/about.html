  <p>‘Weblogin’ is the UTORauth web single sign-on service. It is used with hundreds of University services to provide authentication via UTORid/password/eToken. It also provides ‘coarse-grained’ authorization attributes such as affiliation and email address which can be used by services to create and maintain local accounts as well as restrict access. Weblogin uses Shibboleth as the underlying technology.  </p>
