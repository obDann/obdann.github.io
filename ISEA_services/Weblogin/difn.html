  <p>Members of the University of Toronto community often have a first name other than an official name that they use to identify themselves to others. Recognizing this, the University of Toronto allows members to set and use their preferred first name. Differentiating between the preferred and official first names allows the University to enable individual preference in applications that do not have a requirement to use official names. Based on approval of the IAM advisory committee this implementation plan will enact the adoption of a consolidated Display Name across the Universityâ€™s IT infrastructure.  </p>
