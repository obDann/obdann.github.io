<h3 class="center-header">October 2018: Disable IPv6 in the Adminsys VPN</h3>
ISEA is making configuration change to the administrative VPN to disable IPv6 traffic tunnel form Cisco AnyConnect client to the administrative VPN.   Currently, there is no service on the administrative VPN running IPv6 so this change will not affect end-user accessing resources protected by the VPN.  In addition, a couple of departments reported issues accessing departmental resource via IPv6 since the AnyConnect client would route all IPv6 traffic via the VPN.  We are disabling IPv6 on the VPN to avoid conflict with the departmental IPv6 network.
