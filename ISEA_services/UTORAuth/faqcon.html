Quick Access:
<ul id="oon">
  <li><a href="#find">I think I already have a UTORid. How do I find out what it is?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#forgot">What if I forgotten my password?</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="find">I think I already have a UTORid. How do I find out what it is?</h3>
<p>It should be printed on your TCard:</p>
<img src="https://tcard.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Terry-Lee-TCard-2019.jpg" style="width:25%;height:25%;">
<p>Alternatively, if you know your UTORmail address and password, you can go to the UTORid website and click on “get information”. Enter your email name (without the @utoronto.ca) and your password.</p> 


<h3 id="forgot">What if I forgotten my password?</h3>

<p>Students (alumnae included), faculty, and staff in Toronto can visit one of the three locations authorized to change passwords:</p>

<ul id="oon">
  <li>St. George Campus: Information Commons Help Desk, First floor, Robarts Library. Hours of operation can be found <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/ic/helpdesk/helpdeskhours.html">here</a></li>
  <li>University of Toronto at Mississauga Service Desk, CCT Building Atrium #0160, Monday-Friday 8:00-8:00 Saturday-Sunday 9:00-5:00.</li>

<p>If your circumstances make these options impossible, you may contact the Information Commons Help Desk at either (416) 978-HELP or <a href="mailto:help.desk@utoronto.ca">help.desk@utoronto.ca</a> Students also have the option of using the challenge questions, if they have set this up in the ROSI SWS. Short term guests should contact their sponsor (the person who gave them their UTORid).</p>
