<h2 class="center-header">Here's how it works.</h2>

<div id="oon">
  <h3>1. Identification.</h3>
  <p>UTORauth is the University of Toronto’s central authorization and authentication database. Your life in UTORauth starts when you first enter the university; perhaps as a student or staff member, maybe just as a temporary contractor doing work for the U of T. UTORauth collects ID data from a variety of authoritative sources around campus and merges all of this information together. Once we know who you are, we issue you a UTORid.      </p>
  <h3>2. Authentication.</h3>
  <p>Think of the UTORid like your digital driver’s license. You need one to navigate the highways and byways of the U of T’s electronic resources. This UTORid, along with the password you choose, will be the primary method of validating yourself to each of the many websites, applications and portals that make up the U of T’s internet presence.</p>
  <h3>3. Authorization.</h3>
  <p>Once you have authenticated yourself to an application, it will have to decide what you are authorized to do. Similar to the way that presenting your driver’s licence at the passport office and the bank will give you different sets of privileges. Applications do this by querying UTORauth’s central database of roles. Is she a student? Graduate or undergraduate? Is he a staff member? Is she a faculty member? It is up to the application to decide what you are allowed to do based on who you are.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="center-header">What is a UTORid?</h2>
<div id="oon">
  Your UTORid (along with your password) is your userid for a number of different services. Some of these are:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://q.utoronto.ca/">Quercus</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://webmail.utoronto.ca/">UTmail+</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wireless.utoronto.ca/">Wireless Network</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://weblogin.utoronto.ca/">UTORweblogin</a></li>
  </ul>
  An increasing number of websites are using Weblogin to give users the experience of single sign-on. You log in (authenticate) once using your UTORid and password and you can access participating websites without having to authenticate again. For more information, please see weblogin.

  <p>There are other services.  Not everyone is eligible for every service.</p>

<h2 class="center-header">UTORauth in Action</h2>
<div id="oon">
  <p>Here are a few uses of the UTORauth system around campus. These are provided as an overview of some of the possible uses for UTORauth, not as an exhaustive list. For questions about gaining access to UTORable resources, please read our FAQ or contact Russell Sutherland for more information.</p>
  <h3>my.access</h3>
  <p>my.access is the Library’s portal to numerous resources including online journals and book renewal screens. <a href="http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca">http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca</a>  </p>
  <h3>UTM</h3>
  <p>UTM receives a feed of all students registered at the UTM campus. They use this data to power a number of applications including:  </p>
  <ul id="oon">
    <li>Audio Visual equipment booking for rooms on campus</li>
    <li>The UTM Computing Services work request Trouble Ticket Application</li>
    <li>and many more...</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Athletic Centre</h3>
  <p>The Athletic Centre uses UTORauth data to limit access to their facilities on the basis of student status.  </p>
  <h3>ECF</h3>
  <p>The computer labs in the Bahen building are locked with a centralized locking system. The ECF administers this sytem, and uses UTORauth data to allow access to certain students and faculty. ECF provides a set of criterion according to the ROSI post codes, and all students matching these criterion are selected from UTORauth.  </p>
  <h3>CDF</h3>
  <p>The Computing Disciplines Facility gets a listing of students who are in some way affiliated with the Computer Science department. They use this information to manage accounts on the computers.  </p>
  <h3>Facilities and Services</h3>
  <p>Facilities and Services are using Weblogin and UTORable to authenticate users to their online parking permit purchase application. See the website below for more information about this service. <a href="http://www.fs.utoronto.ca/English/page-10-12421-1.html">On-Line Student Permit Purchase</a>  </p>
  <h3>Faculty of Architecture</h3>
  <p>The Department of Architecture uses a feed from UTORauth to authenticate users and offer customized content on their website.  </p>
  <h3>TCard Office</h3>
  <p>Historically, the <a href="http://www.utorauth.utoronto.ca/?page=dictionary#TCard">TCard</a> office produced TCards with data from the library. UTORauth has taken over management of this database and making sure it contains the most recent information. <a href="http://www.library.utoronto.ca/services/card/when.html">http://www.library.utoronto.ca/services/card/when.html</a>  </p>
  <h3>The Computer Access Facilities</h3>
  Various CAFs around campus require users to authenticate with their UTORid before using the computers. A real-time query is sent first to Kerberos to authenticate the user, and then to the UTORable LDAP server to determine what level of access the user should have. <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/ic/caf/">http://sites.utoronto.ca/ic/caf/</a>
  <h3>The Help Desk</h3>
  The Help Desk  gather information about a student from UTORauth in real time. The application permits a search of UTORauth by some of the student’s primary identifiers.
