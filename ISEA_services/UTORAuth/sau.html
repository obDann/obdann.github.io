  <p>You may find yourself with a need to give a UTORid to a person who does not fit the criteria for the standard UTORid that is given to students, staff and faculty. Perhaps you have a visiting professor or a contractor doing some work for your department. Maybe there is a conference being held and you would like to give some of the attendees guest access to the campus wireless network. UTORauth provides two separate types of UTORids aimed at meeting this need.  </p>
  <div class="sub-heading">Short-Term Guest UTORids</div>
  This type of UTORid is intended to be sponsored for those with a very short term of affiliation with the university, 5 days or less. Because of this, they are created through a self-serve process which can be found <a href="#how-to-short">below</a>
  <div class="sub-heading">Long-Term Guest UTORids</div>
  When your guest is going to be around for a period of greater than 5 days this will be the proper route to pursue. The process for sponsoring a UTORid of this type involves writing a letter of introduction for your guest and having them visit the Reader Registration desk in Robarts Library. It is described in more detail on the <a href="#how-to-long">Long-Term Guest UTORid page</a>.
  <div class="sub-heading">Affiliate Guest UTORids</div>
  If you have a population of users who are affiliated with the University but should not have full staff or student privileges, you may use the isaffiliate flag.  Please get in touch with our IAM team to talk about this option: <a href="mailto:utorauth@utoronto.ca">utorauth@utoronto.ca</a>.
  <div class="sub-heading">ServIDs</div>
  ServID is the UTORid used by systems and applications(non-human). The implementations of those IDs must be implemented in a manner to ensure that their passwords are capable of being changed once annually. The process to request a ServID is described <a href="#how-to-serv">here Instruction for Requesting ServID</a>.
