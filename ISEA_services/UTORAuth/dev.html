<button class="collapsible">I’d like to use UTORauth for my application; where do I start?</button>
<div class="colla">
  <p>All queries regarding access to UTORauth resources should be directed towards <a href=" utorauth@utoronto.ca"> utorauth@utoronto.ca</a>, In your email, please be sure to include a one or two paragraph description of the service you will be providing.  </p>

<button class="collapsible">Does UTORauth decide who has access to the data?</button>
<div class="colla">
  <p>No. Since UTORauth is not the authoritative source for this data, we cannot permit access directly. However, UTORauth will act as a broker between you and the authoritative source to set up the access privileges.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">I’m going to be building my database from the UTORable LDAP directory. Is there an appropriate time of day to do this?</button>
<div class="colla">
  <p>No. If you are planning on having a local copy of the data you receive from UTORauth, please consider setting up a batch feed. These are created daily and significantly reduce the load on the LDAP server.  </p>
