<h3 class="center-header">What is an eToken?</h3>
<ul id="oon">
  <li>The eToken is the Universityâ€™s multi-factor authentication product, and is used to connect to high-value applications like AMS, ARBOR, and ROSI. </li>
  <li>It is a small USB device that is plugged into your computer or laptop when you require access to these systems. </li>
  <li>Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is a method of authentication that provides high assurance of identity and is often defined as a combination of something you have (the eToken) with something you know (your UTORID and password). This method of authentication provides higher assurance of identity than use of UTORID and password alone. </li>
