<h3>SAM Management Server Migration</h3>
<p>Written: January 22, 2019</p>

<p>On January 31, 2019, we will migrate the SAM server(SAM manage Center) from version 8.2 to version 9.0.</p>

<p>SAM manager client and SAC client must be upgraded to work with SAM 9. The newer version is backward compatible with SAM 8.2 and can be downloaded from <a href="https://secure.sis.utoronto.ca/software/safenet-etoken-clients/">https://secure.sis.utoronto.ca/software/safenet-etoken-clients/</a>.</p>

<p>To upgrade the softwares, you need to uninstall the old version before install the new version.</p>

<p>Note: If your machine is UTORcsi domain managed, you donâ€™t need to worry about the software upgrade. The domain supervisor will perform the software upgrade for your machine.</p>

<p>If you have further questions, please email to <a href="mailto:auth.admin@utoronto.ca">auth.admin@utoronto.ca</a></p>
